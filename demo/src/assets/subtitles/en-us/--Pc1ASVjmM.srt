00:00:00,410 --> 00:00:03,360
So let me add numbers to this diagram over here.

2
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:06,835
Say the age ranges from 0 to 80, and

3
00:00:06,835 --> 00:00:11,980
your net worth might be 500 at its best whatever that means.

4
00:00:13,590 --> 00:00:18,800
So if you were 80 years old your net worth would be exactly 500.

5
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:23,450
And I want you to give me an equation that describes this line that

6
00:00:23,450 --> 00:00:28,960
passes to the point 80, 500 and 0, 0 over here.

7
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:37,150
So net worth should be some number times the age, plus some other number.

8
00:00:37,150 --> 00:00:40,740
Can you fill in these two numbers over here that describe this graph?
